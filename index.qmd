-   Menu pages
-   Charts with ggplot2
-   Lightbox  Gallery
-   Blog posts
-   About page

<!-- 
1.  It will be ignored by Quarto: When Quarto processes your `.qmd` file to generate output (like an HTML page, PDF, Word document, etc.), it will completely ignore everything between.
2.  It will not appear in the final output: This text  will NOT be visible in the rendered document your audience sees.
3.  It's for the author(s): Comments like this are used by the document author(s) for various purposes:
    *   **Notes to self:** Reminders of things to add, fix, or check later (this seems likely given the content â€“ placeholders for information to be added).
    *   **Explanations:** Leaving notes explaining complex parts of the code or document structure.
    *   **Temporarily hiding content:** You can wrap content to temporarily remove it from the output without deleting the source text.
    *   **Collaboration:** Leaving notes for other people working on the same document.
