\

This Website/Blog is made with [Quarto, Creating a Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).\
The idea is to have a **minimal website skeleton** with a:

-   Landing page / Home
-   Content page with downloads
-   Menu pages
-   Blog posts
-   About page


### Themes

HTML documents rendered with Quarto use Bootstrap 5 by default.\
\
Websites/Blogs can use any of the 25 [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) themes included with Quarto. For example, this website uses the cosmo theme. See the 25 themes [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) and the .scss theme files are [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/tree/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/themes).\
\
You can also [create your own](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#theme-options) themes.\
