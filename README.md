# web_quarto_template

Website template build with Quarto.

You can visit this template at :https://mortenlorenzen.github.io/web_quarto_template/

The idea is to have a **minimal website skeleton** with:

-   Landing page
-   Content page with downloads
-   Menu pages
-   Blog posts
-   About page

You are welcome to get inspired and go for the code.

Note:\
Since this site is published with GitHub pages the html folder needs to be named "docs". I do this by adding *output_dir: "docs"* in the "\_site.yml" file. Otherwise is the default foldername "\_site". (See also: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/publish_website.html)
