# web_quarto_template

Website template build with Quarto.

You can visit this template at :https://mortenlorenzen.github.io/web_quarto_template/

The idea is to have a **minimal website skeleton** with:

-   Landing page
-   Content page with downloads
-   Menu pages
-   Blog posts
-   About page

You are welcome to get inspired and go for the code.\
